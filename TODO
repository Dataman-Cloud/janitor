1 As a API gateway, janitor should be able to foward any HTTP requests to avaliable backends.
2 As a reverse proxy, janitor should be able to find avaliable backends and make sure only fowards requests to healthy backends.
3 Way to discover health instances of a backend.
4 Application requests metrics, extract information like throughout rate, fail rate, slow requests etc
5 HTTPs support
6 Websocket support
7 HTTP API of this server
8 Route table, how to map a requests to a specific backends
9 Backend weights support / canary support in the future



Later Maybe:
1, Serve as a Dns Proxy server
2, Raft protocol to synchorize with multiple instance of janitor
3, Rate limit
